# 📈 Business-Focused Recommendations: Predicting Subscriber Response

## 🔍 Summary for Business Stakeholders

This project aimed to help the marketing/sales team **predict which customers are most likely to subscribe** after a phone campaign. We trained and evaluated multiple models, and each offers trade-offs depending on your business goals.

## ✅ Business-Oriented Recommendations

| **Business Objective**                                 | **Recommended Strategy**                    | **Why It Matters**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎯 Maximize sales team efficiency                      | Use **Precision-Focused Model** (e.g., SVM) | Reduces false positives → sales reps only contact most likely subscribers.         |
| 📣 Expand outreach and catch more potential customers  | Use **Recall-Focused Model** (e.g., Logistic Regression w/ SMOTE) | Captures more actual subscribers, useful for broad campaigns.        |
| ⚖️ Balanced strategy with explainability               | Use **Decision Tree (Tuned)**               | Balances catching subscribers with minimizing false leads. Easy to explain.         |
| 🚫 Avoid ineffective models                            | Skip **K-Nearest Neighbors**                | Missed too many real subscribers. Not suited for imbalanced datasets.              |

## 🧠 Strategic Takeaways

- **Different models = different business strategies.**
- Choose **precision** when you have limited resources (e.g., small sales team).
- Choose **recall** when your goal is **reach and coverage**.
- Use **balanced models** (like Decision Trees) when both matter and interpretability is important.
- Data techniques like **SMOTE** and **hyperparameter tuning** improve outcomes significantly.

## 📌 Next Steps

- Automate this model to rank customers before outreach.
- Combine model output with CRM tools or dashboards.
- Monitor for performance drift and retrain every 6–12 months.
